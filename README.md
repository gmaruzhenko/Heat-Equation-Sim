Code solves problem 3 for Math257 question set

Problem 3:

Consider the following problem for the heat equation:

ut = α
2uxx + s(x), 0 < x < L, u(0, t) = u1, u(L, t) = u2, u(x, 0) = f(x),
where the term s(x) describes the external source.

(a) Let α
2 = 1 and s(x) = kx/L, where k is a constant. Find the steady-state and transient solution to this problem.

(b) Assume that u1 = 1 and u2 = 3, L = 2, k = 1/2, and that f(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L. Plot the steady-state solution
and u(x, t) versus x for several values of t.
